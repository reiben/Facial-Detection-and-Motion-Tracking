# Overview
This repository contains 2 simple projects in Python using OpenCV (Computer Vision)
i.e a Facial Detection System and Motion Tracker

# Dependencies
To run both the programs you may require:
1. OpenCV Library </br>
2. Numpy Library </br>
You can install both these libraries using: </br>
`pip install opencv-python` </br>
`pip install numpy`</br>

# Facial Detection
According to Wikipedia, Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.</br>
OpenCV Python Library provides an inbuild algorithm to detect faces which uses a Machine Learning Classifier called Haar Cascade.</br>
You can check [this link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjWs9SqlbLlAhVh73MBHeqmCGkQFjACegQICxAH&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FHow-do-Haar-cascades-work&usg=AOvVaw3EE1O4d6VV2KEn_3_9pRAp) to see how this algorithm works</br>
2 Classifiers required for the program are present in this repository, However you can check more Classifiers in the OpenCV GitHub repository.

# Motion Tracking
Motion Tracking is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. It is used in military, entertainment, sports, medical applications, and for validation of computer vision and robotics.</br>
Here's a screenshot of the program:</br>
